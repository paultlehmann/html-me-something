	<p class="intro">Greetings, thirsty reader!  Let this page serve as your irrigated oasis, for you have stumbled upon ST. LOUIS'S NUMBER ONE WEB RESOURCE for all things water fountain, drinking fountain, and other public hydration receptacle!</p><br>
	<p class="intro">The true connoisseur knows that all water fountains are certainly not created equal.  The choice of a hydration location should be made carefully, with due consideration given to accessibility, temperature, flow, and drinking environment.  These "big four" factors can make or break a drinking experience, and with it potentially an entire day.</p><br>
	<p class="intro">So without further ado, allow us to present the DEFINITIVE TOP THREE WATER FOUNTAINS in the St. Louis area!</p>

Accessibility is a downside, as you have to feign an interest in iron products or else be asked to leave, but overall it's still one of the best drinks of water you can find around town.</p></td>

This fountain-within-Fountain distinguishes itself above all else with the most impressive flow, bar none, of any drinking receptable in eastern Missouri - you'll hardly even notice the temperature, which is solid as well.  Accessibility and drinking environment vary greatly depending on what time of day you go.</p></td>

			<td colspan="5"><p class="review">I'm sure all you fountain aficionados out there saw this one coming a mile away. Brookdale Senior Center has defined itself over the years not just as a reliable place to store elderly relatives, but even more so as the premier place in town to get a drink of water.  The dual fountains (the one on the left is the original; its slightly-lower twin was installed in 2017 to cope with frequent lines) have become a local Mecca of sorts, with thirsty travelers driving as much as an hour to sip from its spout. And with good reason: you simply cannot find this combination of temperature and flow anywhere else. Accessibility is a breeze, with the only challenge sometimes being leaving if you have attracted a flock of seniors. The negative impact this can have on the drinking environment is really the only criticism that can possibly be leveled at this fountain.</p></td>
